### A Progressive Web App that I created as my personal website/portfolio a few years ago. I'm currently in the process of updating it.

## Installation

The easiest way to check this project out is simply by visiting https://johnreynolds3d.github.io in your browser (tested in Chrome), but if you _really_ want to get under the hood and get your hands dirty...

1.  Clone this repository
    ```
    # git clone git@github.com:johnreynolds3d/johnreynolds3d.github.io.git
    ```
2.  cd into the source directory
    ```
    # cd johnreynolds3d.github.io
    ```
3.  Run the following command to start a server on port 8000
    ```
    # python3 -m http.server
    ```
4.  Open your web browser of choice (tested on Chrome) and enter the URL
    'localhost:8000'; that should get you to the home page

Many of the pages are interactive; try the WASD keys, or move around with the cursor (or your finger on a touchscreen). Enjoy!
