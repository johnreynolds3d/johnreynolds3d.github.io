        <h1>What Now? <br />Changing Goals and Moving Toward the Future</h1>
        <h3>17 NOVEMBER 2017</h3>
        <p>
          In 2016, as my time at the University of Western Australia drew to a close, I found my interest shifting from
          Artificial Intelligence toward Virtual Reality. A fascination with the concept of the
          <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22930661-800-vision-of-singularity-questions-ai-intellect/"
            >Technological Singularity</a
          >
          had been a major factor in my motivation to study Computer Science, but after building some simple VR apps in
          <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>, I was hooked!
        </p>
        <p>
          After reading (OK, <i>listening to</i> on Audible) the obligatory VR primers &mdash; Neal Stephenson's
          <a href="https://www.audible.com.au/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Snow-Crash-Audiobook/B00FGJSMKK">Snow Crash</a>, and
          Ernest Cline's
          <a href="https://www.audible.com.au/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Ready-Player-One-Audiobook/B00FEZBS84"
            >Ready Player One</a
          >
          &mdash; and while looking for inspiration in the works of prominent artists and designers, I stumbled across
          <a href="http://www.raycaesar.com/">Ray Caesar</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I fell immediately in love with his aesthetic, but I was staggered to learn that his images were not, as I had
          assumed, two-dimensional digital paintings, but renderings of 3D models set in painstakingly textured
          environments; each character rigged with a poseable 'skeleton' and lit as if on the set of a motion picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an interview, the artist fondly recalled returning to one of these 'scenes' after several years and
          discovering a letter he had penned to his wife, left in a digital chest of drawers and long since forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          I eagerly immersed myself in learning the fundamentals of this seemingly boundless creative medium with
          Autodesk's <a href="https://www.autodesk.com.au/products/maya/overview">Maya</a> (Mr. Caesar's tool of
          choice), then The Foundry's <a href="https://www.foundry.com/products/modo">Modo</a>, finally settling on the
          free and open-source <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I found out about <a href="https://webvr.info/">WebVR</a>. I hadn't been all that taken with Web
          Development during the brief overview that my degree's schedule afforded, but the idea that these virtual
          worlds could be delivered on a ubiquitous platform like the web sealed the deal for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this website is to act as my portfolio as I learn how to build something resembling at least one
          small corner of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">Metaverse</a>.
